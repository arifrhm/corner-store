# BUIDL-like ERC-3643 Demo Profile

## Status

Current demo profile; not real BlackRock/Securitize BUIDL integration.

## Purpose

This profile lets the MVP demonstrate how a BUIDL-like regulated fund asset can trade through Corner Store's protected Router path using the existing ERC-3643/T-REX fixture and the Corner Store Manifest/Recipe/Element model.

The test model is an ERC20-style BUIDL reference asset converted into a local ERC-3643/T-REX test issuance. It is not a bridge, wrapper, or live integration with the real BUIDL token.

The goal is to prove the product flow, not to claim production compatibility with the real BUIDL token.

External transfer-agent integration is also modeled, not connected. The test
suite uses a mock Securitize/TA-style fixture as the source of investor facts,
then syncs those facts into the local ERC-3643/T-REX identity registry and
Corner Store Elements.

## Current implementation

- Demo profile: `src/demo/BuidlLikeDemoAsset.sol`
- Mock TA fact source: `test/fixtures/MockSecuritizeTA.sol`
- Integration fixture: `test/integration/BUIDLLikeFlow.t.sol`
- ERC-3643/T-REX harness: `test/fixtures/TREXSuite.sol`

The demo deploys a standard ERC-3643/T-REX token with BUIDL-like metadata:

- token name: `BUIDL-like ERC-3643 Demo Asset`
- token symbol: `bBUIDL`
- issuance recipe: Reg D 506(c)
- fund recipe: generic QP + minimum-amount recipe family `3`, immutable version `2`
- fund applicability: `factsPacked` bit 0
- minimum trade amount: `5,000,000` local demo units supplied through
  versioned `ManifestPolicyConfig`
- supported execution engine: AMM in the current fixture

## Compliance model

The current profile intentionally keeps BUIDL-specific behavior out of token override code.

```text
BUIDL-like asset facts
  -> ManifestCore
  -> Recipe binding
  -> Element checks
  -> Router-protected execution
  -> ERC-3643 transfer-time verification
```

Current demo checks:

- KYC/identity verification through the ERC-3643/T-REX fixture
- sanctions clear through `A-01-v1`
- accredited investor through `A-03-v1`
- qualified purchaser through `A-13-v1`
- generic minimum trade amount through `MIN-AMOUNT-v1`
- ERC-3643 recipient verification at token transfer time

Investor facts are seeded through `MockSecuritizeTA`, not by calling the AI/QP
Elements directly from the BUIDL flow test. This keeps the demo shaped like the
production seam without pretending to have a real Securitize or transfer-agent
connection.

The `5,000,000` threshold is only a local behavior-lock value. It is not a
production BUIDL product term, is not exported as a production default, and
must not be activated without issuer/legal evidence in a schema-v5 onboarding
artifact. The previous `BUIDL-MIN-v1` Element and recipe family `3` version `1`
remain only as immutable historical implementations; current deployments do
not register or bind them.

```text
MockSecuritizeTA profile
  -> sync into ERC-3643 identity registry when KYC is current
  -> sync AI/QP/sanctions flags into test Elements
  -> Router evaluate()
  -> ERC-3643 transfer-time verification
```

## DS Protocol / Securitize mapping

Public Securitize DS Protocol material describes a Compliance Service style boundary around token operations, including validation / pre-transfer checks. Corner Store should not replace its ERC-3643 identity model with DS-specific internals. The integration boundary should be an adapter.

| DS / TA concept | Corner Store demo equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| DSToken / permissioned token | ERC-3643/T-REX token fixture |
| Compliance Service | Corner Store `ComplianceEngine` + ERC-3643 transfer-time checks |
| pre-transfer validation | Router `evaluate()` before adapter execution + token `canTransfer` during settlement |
| Wallet / whitelist manager | ERC-3643 `IdentityRegistry` + ONCHAINID claims |
| TA / trusted verification source | `MockSecuritizeTA` in tests; future ERC-3643 `TrustedIssuersRegistry` / TrustedIssuer integration |
| investor eligibility facts | mock TA profile now; claim topics consumed by Elements in production |
| audit / reliance context | decision hash, reason code, events, future reliance log |

## Claim topics

The demo follows the PD-4 direction: use ERC-3643-compatible claim topics and a TrustedIssuer-style pipeline rather than inventing a separate identity model.

Initial project-level topics used by the profile:

- `KYC = keccak256("CORNER_STORE.KYC")` in the T-REX fixture
- `ACCREDITED_INVESTOR = 1001`
- `QUALIFIED_PURCHASER = 1002`

The current AI/QP Elements still use settable test flags, but BUIDL-like flow
tests populate those flags through `MockSecuritizeTA`. Production refinement
should replace those flags with ONCHAINID claims carrying issuer, topic,
issuedAt, expiresAt, and revocation/freshness semantics.

## Demo acceptance cases

The BUIDL-like profile should demonstrate:

1. metadata and Manifest binding are correct
2. QP buyer can buy through the protected Router
3. accredited but non-QP buyer is rejected before token movement
4. sanctioned QP buyer is rejected before token movement
5. QP/accredited but ERC-3643-unverified recipient rolls back during token settlement
6. QP/accredited buyer below the BUIDL-like minimum investment is rejected before token movement
7. expired TA profile is not synced into current eligibility and is rejected before token movement

## Non-goals

- real BlackRock BUIDL deployment compatibility
- real Securitize/TA API connection
- real Securitize issuer address / topic mapping
- production claim expiry and revocation integration
- NAV oracle integration
- redemption rail implementation
- monthly distribution rail implementation
- production transfer-agent agreement or legal reliance opinion

## Follow-up work

- Implement ONCHAINID-backed AI/QP claim fixtures.
- Add claim expiry/freshness tests.
- Add Securitize/DS adapter research issue once official/current integration details are available.
- Split primary distribution, secondary DEX execution, redemption, and monthly distribution rails.
- Replace the demo threshold only through reviewed schema-v5
  `ManifestPolicyConfig` onboarding when issuer/legal evidence is available.
